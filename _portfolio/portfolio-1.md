QPrice is a project exploring the intersection of quantum computing and complex computational pricing/optimization problems. Built utilizing **Qiskit**, this project demonstrates how quantum algorithms can be practically applied to handle computational tasks that are traditionally resource-intensive for classical computers. 

### Key Technologies
* **Quantum Framework:** Qiskit
* **Language:** Python
* **Concepts Applied:** Quantum algorithms, circuit design, and optimization techniques.

*Note: If you have a screenshot or diagram of your quantum circuits, save it as `qprice-preview.png` in your `images/` folder to make it show up on the portfolio grid!*
