Hi, I'm Samanvith. I'm an undergraduate studying Computer Science and Engineering. 

My research interests center around deep learning and computer vision, with a specific focus on exploring graph neural networks (GNNs) and machine unlearning. I'm also curious about the practical applications of quantum computing and enjoy sharpening my problem-solving skills through competitive programming.

Away from the keyboard, you'll usually find me playing drums with my band, Swarantraka, planning my next Himalayan trek, or learning German in preparation for my Master's studies. 

Welcome to my digital space! Feel free to explore my projects or reach out to connect.
