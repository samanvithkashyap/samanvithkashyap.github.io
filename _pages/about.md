I'm an undergrad studying Computer Science. 

My research interests center around **deep learning** and **computer vision**, with a specific focus on exploring **graph neural networks (GNNs)** and **machine unlearning**. I'm also passionate about **quantum computing** and enjoy competitive programming.

Away from the keyboard, you'll usually find me playing drums 🥁, planning a trek ⛰️, or learning German 🇩🇪.
